# Mathematical-Foundations-of-Deep-Neural-Networks
This is a project on the article "Theoretical Linear Convergence of Unfolded ISTA and its Practical Weights and Thresholds" by authors Xiaohan Chen, Jialin Liu, Zhangyang Wang, Wotao Yin, ( https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1808.10038) which I did as a part of the course "Mathematical Foundations of Deep Neural Networks" in the second semester of 2022  in the Advanced Mathematics M2 program at ENS de Lyon. The project was done in collaboration with Leo Davy.
